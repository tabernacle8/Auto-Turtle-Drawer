# Auto Turtle Drawer


I created this program because turtle can be boring during a programming class.
Now it can be fun! Just run index.py and draw whatever you like. The converter will automatically make it into a turtle program that you can run in results.txt.

Focus on what's important in programming, don't worry about turtle.

Change the window size (Canvass) By changing the variable at the top of index.py
