# Auto Turtle Drawer


I created this program because turtle can be boring during a programming class.
Now it can be fun! Just run index.py and draw whatever you like. The converter will automatically make it into a turtle program that you can run in results.txt.

Focus on what's important in programming, don't worry about turtle.
